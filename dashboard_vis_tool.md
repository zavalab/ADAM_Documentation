<h1>The Visualization Tool</h1>

<p>
    The visualization tool allows you to visualize the results of completed models or visualize the location and flow data of uploaded data files.

<h2>Visualize Model Result</h2>

<p>
    To visualize the result of a completed model, use the left hand side of the visualization tool and select the desired nodel in the dropdown menu.

<p>
    For more information about using the visualization tool to view model results, see the 
<a href="/ADAM_Documentation/dashboard_results.html#vis_model_results">Interpreting the Results Tutorial</a>
</p>

<h2>Uploading New Data</h2> 

<p>
    If you have geographical data and flow results, you can directly visualize the results without having to run a model. In this section of the tutorial, we will be using example files, which can be found 
<a href="">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    First, select <b>Go</b> in order to enter the visualization tool. Then, select the <b>Upload Data File</b> button, located at the top of the page. 
</p>

<p>
    After selecting <b>Upload Data File</b>, you can now upload the data files to the visualization tool and select the desired mapping style.

<h3>Straight Line Mapping Style</h3>

<p>
    If you select the Straight Line mapping style, the flow data is represented as straight lines from one node to another. You may hover over the lines in order to display the distance and flow data. 
</p>

<p>
    This style of mapping is good when you only want a rough estimate of the flow data. 
</p>

<h3>Routing Mapping Style</h3>

<p>
    If you select the Routing mapping style, the visualization tool will display the shortest routes that a vehicle will take in order to get from one node to another. This method of mapping provides a much more accurate view of the transportation pathways.
</p>

<h3>Hybrid Mapping Style</h3>

<p>
    In a hybrid mapping style, the flow pathways are displayed in a Straight Line mapping method, but you can also hover over the straight lines and click in order to toggle the routing pathways. This method of mapping combines the Straight Line and Hybrid mapping methods, and it displayes the most information.
