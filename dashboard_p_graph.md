<h1>Process Graph (P-Graph)</h1>

<p>
    As long as you have technology data inputted in the model, you can access the Process graph. A process graph is a diagram that contains all possible combinations of the technologies and products in the system. This allows you to quickly and easily identify all potential supply chain pathways. P-Graphs consist of raw materials, intermediate products, final products, and technologies. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Raw Materials</b> are unprocessed materials used to make other products (e.g. milk). <b>Intermediate Products</b> are products that can be used as an input to make other goods (e.g. milk produces cheese which can then be used to make pizza. Cheese is an intermediate product). <b>Final Products</b> are products that cannot be further processed into a new product (e.g. pizza). <b>Technologies</b> are any equipment or processes that can transform one product to another (e.g. cheese factory)
</p>

<p>
    In a process diagram, raw materials are depicted as yellow circles, technologies are depicted as gray rectangles, intermediate products are depicted as blue circles, and final products are depicted as green circles.

<h2>Dairy Supply Chain Example</h2>

<p>
    The example below shows a p-graph for a milk processing supply chain containing three technologies. 
</p>

<p>
    Milk can go through the Ice Cream Factory and be made into ice cream, or it can go through the Cheese Factory and be made into cheese. Ice cream is a final product which can be directly sold to the customer, while the cheese can further be processed by the Pizza Factory to make Pizza. Pizza is a final product that can be sold directly to customers.

<h2>Nutrient Pollution Control Example</h2>

<p>
    Technologies do not have to take in only one material and only output one product. There can be many combinations of materials, technologies, and products. An example of a simplified p-graph for the nutrient pollution case study is shown below.

<p>
    In this example, raw manure can go through solid-liquid separation (SLS) technology or P Release technology. SLS produces two intermediate products, the solid component can be further processed into pellets while the liquid component can go through P release technology to generate phosphorus. The P release technology can take in raw manure, liquid manure, or solid manure and produces Phosphorus.

<h2>Waste to Energy Example</h2>

<p>
    The image below shows an example of a P-Graph generated by ADAM. This is the P-graph shown for the Waste to Energy case study. Based on the P-Graph, the Waste to Energy case study only has one type of technology in the system which is an Anaerobic Digestion + Electricity generation technology.
